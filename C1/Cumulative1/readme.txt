C# Cumulative Part 1 

This ASP.NET Core MVC web application implements the READ functionality for managing teacher/course/student data in the school database 
that was provided by the teacher. It provides API endpoints for retrieving teacher information and web pages for displaying teacher list 
and individual teacher details, and does the same for course and students. Important feature includes API endpoints at /api/teacher and 
/api/teacher/{id}, web page at /TeacherPage/List and /TeacherPage/Show/{id}, search functionality on the teacher list page, Entity Framework
for Data Access and swagger for API documents. I'll be focusing on teacher API however the same is done with student and course API as well
